# url-shortner

### URL Shortner Project using Python
- A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. Sometimes a URL can be too lengthy to send and we cannot track the number of clicks the URL is getting. Here's when URL-shortner comes into picture.
- A URL Shortner not only shortens the URL length, but also gives us the option to customise the url, and also track the activity at the backend.
- Popular URL Shortner websites are: Bitly, cuttly, TinyURL.com, Goo.gl

### Pre-requisites

  - Cuttly is a free custom URL Shortener and provides branded URLs with advanced links tracking and Link Management Platform & API. Shorten and replace long URL to short link.
  - Along with link shortening. cuttly also provides the API documentation for shortening links under domain cutt.ly
  - So first we will have to create and account on cuttly (https://cutt.ly/)
  - After registration of your account, go to the profile section and copy the API key.
